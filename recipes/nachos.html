        <p><h3><em>Something this easy to make should not taste 
            this good.</em></h3></p>
        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Tortilla chips</li>
            <li>Sauce 1/2 of your choice (Guac)</li>
            <li>Sauce 2/2 of your choice (Sour cream)</li>
            <li>Cheese 1/2 of your choice (Whatever cheese you pick, make sure it's shredded)</li>
            <li>Cheese 2/2 of your choice (Again, make sure it's shredded)</li>
            <li>Protein of your choice (Minced ground beef)</li>
            <li>(Optional) veggie of your choice (shredded lettuce)</li>
            <li>(Optional) Spice of your choice (Personally I am not a spice person
                but most people use jalapeno)
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><strong><em>Remember: you want to make your nachos close to when you plan on eating, 
            this is not something you make for later. Once you make your nachos, the tortilla 
            chips can only remain chrunchy for so long before they eventually turn soggy. 
            Nobody likes soggy nachos. 
        </em></strong></p>
